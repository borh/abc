//! Source-region ownership and minimal-diff source splicing.
//!
//! Source edits preserve formatting outside the affected construct. Serializing
//! the whole tree with [`Tree::to_source`] would canonicalize unrelated text.
//!
//! This layer answers, for every byte of the sanitized source, two questions:
//!
//! 1. **Who owns each source byte?** [`Tree::regions`] projects the
//!    source-node table into a *total, non-overlapping, ordered* tiling: one
//!    [`Region`] per classified node plus the interstitial plain runs
//!    between them. Concatenating every region's bytes reproduces
//!    [`Tree::sanitized`] exactly.
//!
//! 2. **How is this region edited coherently?** Each region carries a
//!    terminal [`SpliceSafety`]:
//!    - [`Direct`](SpliceSafety::Direct) — the region fully owns its rendered
//!      content (a self-contained node, or plain interstitial text), so
//!      replacing its bytes is a complete edit.
//!    - [`Coupled`](SpliceSafety::Coupled) — a coherent edit spans a *derived
//!      partner*: the upstream literal of a non-adjacent forward reference
//!      ([`ForwardOrigin::Referenced`]), a heading hint, a margin note, or the
//!      paired marker of a container. The partner is recovered on demand
//!      ([`Tree::coupling`]) and the edit is checked by re-parse.
//!    - [`Opaque`](SpliceSafety::Opaque) — a future node variant this build of
//!      the parser does not classify (forward-compat only; never produced by
//!      any construct this version understands).
//!
//! [`Tree::splice`] performs the edit and returns the minimal-diff source —
//! every byte outside the affected region(s) stays identical, unlike the
//! whole-document reflow of [`Tree::to_source`]. A coupled edit *derives* the
//! partner change, re-parses the candidate, and **verifies** the construct
//! re-formed; it returns [`SpliceError`] rather than emit a byte-valid but
//! semantically desynced edit. The parser is the single source of truth for
//! "what couples to what" — this layer proposes, the parser confirms.
//!
//! # Why this shape
//!
//! Nothing is stored on the AST to support the splice. The coupling of a
//! forward reference is exactly the irreducible [`ForwardOrigin`] provenance
//! stored on each forward node; a container's pairing is the structural
//! nesting already present in [`Tree::source_nodes`]. The splice model is the
//! dual of the parser's classification, derived entirely on demand from data
//! that already exists.
//!
//! Incremental *re-parse* (reusing the unaffected tree across an edit) is a
//! separate performance concern, not part of this model: the parser is
//! single-digit milliseconds on real corpus documents, so the verify re-parse
//! is cheap and there is no current pressure to reuse subtrees.
