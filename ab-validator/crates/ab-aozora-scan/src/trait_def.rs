//! Output channel abstraction for trigger-byte scanners.
//!
//! Replaces an eager `Vec<u32>`-returning entry shape with a
//! visitor-style sink so kernels can write trigger offsets directly
//! into the caller's preferred buffer (heap `Vec`, bumpalo arena
//! `BumpVec`, or a counting sink that records nothing) without the
//! heap → arena memcpy a returned `Vec<u32>` would force on every
//! parse.
//!
//! The sink trait stays generic-method on purpose: the scan loop
//! monomorphises against the concrete sink type, which lets the LLVM
//! inliner fold the `push` call into the match-emit loop with no
//! virtual dispatch overhead — so [`crate::scan_offsets_in`] writes
//! straight into the lex arena with no heap round-trip.
