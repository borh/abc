//! Cross-checks between the tokenize-stage trigger scan and the brute-force
//! [`NaiveScanner`] reference, projected through the whole
//! `lex` pipeline.
//!
//! `aozora-scan/tests/property_backend_equiv.rs` already proves that
//! the production `scan_offsets` agrees byte-for-byte with
//! [`NaiveScanner`] on raw source bytes. That covers a *single layer*
//! (the scanner) and says nothing about how the tokenize stage's output
//! flows through pair / classify on into the lexer's normalized
//! buffer.
//!
//! The properties here close the gap by reasoning about the *whole*
//! pipeline:
//!
//! 1. **Scanner totality on lex output.** [`NaiveScanner`] applied to
//!    the lexer's normalized buffer must not panic and must return
//!    offsets that are valid UTF-8 char boundaries inside that buffer.
//!    The normalized buffer carries PUA sentinels and may differ in
//!    length from the source; a regression that left dangling bytes
//!    or invalidated boundaries would surface here.
//!
//! 2. **Tokenize-stage monotonicity.** The Aozora pipeline can only *consume*
//!    triggers (replacing them with PUA sentinels); it never adds
//!    new ones. Therefore the count of triggers in the *normalized*
//!    buffer is at most the count in the *source* (modulo the sanitize
//!    stage's rewrites: BOM strip, CRLF→LF, accent decomposition).
//!    A regression that emitted a trigger in the normalized output
//!    where none existed in source would shift this delta.
//!
//! Both properties are stated as inequalities rather than equalities:
//! the sanitize stage can drop bytes (BOM, CR) and rewrite sequences
//! (`〔NFC〕` → combining), so a strict "trigger count is equal"
//! property would produce false positives. The inequality
//! properties remain decisive: any regression that *adds* triggers
//! during normalization fails them under shrinking.
