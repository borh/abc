//! Round-trip + uniqueness invariants for [`Sentinel`].
//!
//! The PUA sentinel scheme is the single point through which every
//! phase of the lex pipeline talks about Aozora-vs-plain bytes: a
//! `from_char` / `as_char` mismatch silently misroutes every entry in
//! every registry. The properties here gate that surface against:
//!
//! 1. `from_char ∘ as_char = Some` for every `Sentinel::ALL` variant
//!    (the pipeline relies on every emitted sentinel being recognised
//!    on the way back).
//! 2. `as_char` is injective over `Sentinel::ALL` (no two variants
//!    encode to the same codepoint, so a registry hit is unambiguous).
//! 3. `from_char(c) = None` for every char outside the four reserved
//!    sentinel codepoints (a stray PUA byte in source data must not
//!    masquerade as a registry sentinel).
//!
//! A 4-variant enum is technically exhaustive without proptest, but
//! the negative property #3 is naturally a property: generate any
//! `char`, exclude the four sentinels, assert `from_char` returns
//! `None`. This validates rejection if a future variant is added.
