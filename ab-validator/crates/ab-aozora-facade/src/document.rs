//! `Document` — single owning handle to a parsed Aozora source
//! buffer, and `Tree<'a>` — a view a caller walks for output rendering.
//!
//! `Document` owns the source buffer; [`Document::parse`] returns a
//! [`Tree<'_>`] whose `'a` lifetime tracks only that `&self` source borrow —
//! the AST data itself is owned, lifetime-free, and `Send + Sync`
//! (an `LexOutput`). Owning source removes the self-referential-struct
//! problem that would otherwise plague driver wrappers (FFI/WASM/Py): callers
//! can hold a `Document` inside any wrapper without juggling source lifetimes.
//!
//! The owned AST stores interned strings and node payloads in a flat
//! `NodeStore` (the owned `StrInterner` deduplicates repeated string content);
//! dropping the tree frees them in one step, with no per-node `Drop`.
