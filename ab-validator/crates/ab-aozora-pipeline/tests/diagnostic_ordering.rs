//! Diagnostic ordering invariants for the fused lex pipeline.
//!
//! Pins the [`Pipeline::build`] documented order:
//!
//!   sanitize → pair → classify
//!
//! Downstream tooling — IDE diagnostics, the CLI's miette renderer,
//! property tests that grep for diagnostic positions — relies on this
//! order being stable, so any change to the pipeline that re-orders
//! diagnostic emission lights up here.
//!
//! The current `Diagnostic` enum (see `crates/aozora-spec/src/diagnostic.rs`)
//! exposes no classify-stage variant for "unrecognised annotation keyword"; an
//! unknown body is folded into `DirectiveKind::Unknown` silently. We
//! therefore pin the sanitize ↔ pair ordering only, with a
//! `classify` placeholder comment marking where a future variant would
//! slot in. The insta snapshot freezes the multi-diagnostic shape
//! end-to-end.
