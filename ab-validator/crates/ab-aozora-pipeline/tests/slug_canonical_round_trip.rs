//! Phase 1.3 (editor-integration sprint) — pin every entry in the
//! canonical [`ab_aozora_spec::SLUGS`] table against the live classify-stage
//! classifier.
//!
//! For each entry we wrap the canonical body in `［＃…］` (or, for
//! forward-reference families like Bouten / `CombineUpright`, in
//! `［＃「対象」に…］` / `［＃「対象」は…］`) and assert that:
//!
//! 1. Parsing produces no `Internal` diagnostic with code
//!    [`codes::RESIDUAL_ANNOTATION_MARKER`] — i.e. the slug landed
//!    in the placeholder registry rather than leaking through as plain
//!    text. That is the closest signal we have to "the parser
//!    recognised this slug" without depending on the (non-public)
//!    `BodyFamily` enum.
//! 2. The normalized text contains exactly one
//!    [`ab_aozora_spec::INLINE_SENTINEL`] / `BLOCK_LEAF_SENTINEL` /
//!    `BLOCK_OPEN_SENTINEL` / `BLOCK_CLOSE_SENTINEL` (depending on the
//!    family) — proving a registry entry was actually emitted.
//!
//! `accepts_param` entries (canonical text contains a `{N}` / `{path}`
//! placeholder) are exercised against a representative substituted
//! body — `2字下げ`, `3字上げ`, `挿絵（fig01.png）入る`.
//!
//! Variant resolutions are covered by the tests in `aozora-spec`.
