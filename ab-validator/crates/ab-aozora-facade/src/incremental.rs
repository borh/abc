//! Owned-AST incremental re-parse engine — the sole incremental path.
//!
//! The retired Stage-A segment cache first proved — over the reference corpus —
//! *where* a document can be cut into independently-lexable spans. This engine
//! carries that insight onto the owned AST: it caches the owned lex output's
//! store-free region-find tables as a structure-sharing [`PieceSeq`] and, on an
//! edit, re-lexes only the minimal balanced region around the edit before
//! splicing that sequence.
//!
//! This module hosts the **region finder** ([`minimal_balanced_region`]), the
//! structure-sharing [`PieceSeq`], the **diagnostics-only splice**
//! ([`reparse_incremental_diagnostics_only`]), and the shared "where is it safe
//! to cut the document" cut helpers. The splice is the production incremental
//! path: it is re-exported from the crate root as the **unstable**
//! [`crate::reparse_incremental_diagnostics_only`] and consumed by the LSP's
//! debounced diagnostics. It is internal-unit-tested and proven
//! byte-identical to a full re-parse by the `corpus_incremental_merge`
//! differential gate.
//!
//! # Stability
//!
//! The incremental re-parse API is pre-1.0 and not subject to semver
//! until the crate reaches v0.5.0.
//!
//! All coordinates here are **sanitized-source** byte offsets (the space every
//! [`LexOutput::source_span`](crate::SourceNode::source_span) and
//! [`LexOutput::pairs`](crate::LexOutput::pairs) indexes); the
//! raw↔sanitized bridge belongs to a later wiring PR. A cut is admitted only
//! where the block-container depth is zero and no resolved delimiter pair
//! straddles it — see [`structurally_safe`].

/// - **Context-sensitive diagnostic or classification**: a `Direct`-classified

///   adjacent region can flip it. (The `Coupled(ForwardReference)` *referenced*
///   forward is already declined above; `Reclaimed` is `Direct` because its
///   rendered bytes are self-contained, but its *diagnostic* is not.) A
///   **self-contained forward reference** (`［＃「X」は太字］` with no earlier
///   `X`) is `Direct` for the same self-contained-bytes reason, but its very
///   *classification* is a whole-prefix predicate (target absence):
///   introducing an earlier `X` in another region flips a full parse to
///   `Reclaimed`/`Referenced` and would resurrect the #228 double-render across
///   the splice boundary, which the node-free region re-lex cannot see — so it
