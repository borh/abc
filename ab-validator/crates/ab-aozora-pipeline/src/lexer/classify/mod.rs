//! Classify stage — classify the pair-stage event stream into [`Node`] spans.
//!
//! Walks the cross-linked [`PairEvent`] stream produced by the pair stage and
//! produces a contiguous vector of [`ClassifiedSpan`] whose
//! `source_span` values tile every byte of the sanitized source
//! end-to-end, in byte-offset order.
//!
//! The span kinds are:
//!
//! * [`SpanKind::Plain`] — a run of text that carries no Aozora
//!   construct. Adjacent events with equal [`PlainProvenance`] are merged;
//!   recovery boundaries remain visible while the normalize stage emits all
//!   plain spans verbatim.
//! * [`SpanKind::Aozora`] — a classified Aozora construct, carrying the
//!   concrete [`Node`] that the normalize stage will replace
//!   with a PUA placeholder sentinel (see [`crate::INLINE_SENTINEL`] and friends).
//! * [`SpanKind::Newline`] — a `\n` in the sanitized text, kept as its
//!   own span kind because block-level annotations (normalize-stage block
//!   sentinel substitution) care about line boundaries.
//!
//! ## Span-coverage invariant
//!
//! When `source.len() > 0`:
//!
//! 1. `spans[0].source_span.start == 0`
//! 2. `spans[i].source_span.end == spans[i + 1].source_span.start`
//! 3. `spans[last].source_span.end == source.len()`
//!
//! When `source.is_empty()`, `spans` is empty.
//!
//! The normalize stage relies on this invariant to emit `normalized` text
//! without ever re-scanning `source`.
//!
//! ## Recogniser layout
//!
//! Every recogniser is a narrow function that inspects a
//! `&[PairEvent]` slice (often one pair's `body_events`) plus the
//! sanitized source. The driver loop's `Classifier::try_recognize`
//! dispatches based on the leading event kind:
//!
//! * Ruby (`｜X《Y》` explicit, trailing-kanji implicit)
//! * Bracket annotations, dispatched on the body keyword:
//!   fixed keyword (`改ページ` / `地付き` / ...), kaeriten
//!   (`一`/`二`/... plus okurigana `（X）`), indent / align-end
//!   (`N字下げ` / `地からN字上げ`), sashie (`挿絵`), forward-ref
//!   bouten, forward-ref TCY, paired-container open / close, and
//!   an `Directive{Unknown}` catch-all.
//! * Gaiji — `※［＃...］` reference-mark + bracket combos.
//! * Double-angle quotation `≪…≫` (displayed as `《…》`) (`AngleQuote`).
//!
//! The catch-all makes every well-formed `［＃…］` bracket produce
//! *some* `Node`, so the Tier-A canary (no bare `［＃` in the
//! HTML output outside an `aozora-directive` wrapper) holds regardless
//! of which specialised recogniser claims the bracket.
//!
//! ## Inlining note (negative result)
//!
//! `classify_subsystems` (instrumented) reports 88 % of classify wall in
//! "iterator-dispatch overhead" and only 9.4 % in actual recogniser
//! leaves. The straightforward fix — sprinkle `#[inline]` on
//! `recognize_and_emit` / `try_ruby_emit` / `try_bracket_emit` /
//! `try_gaiji_emit` / `process_event` / `handle_top_level` /
//! `handle_stream_event` / `Iterator::next` — was tried and reverted:
//! aggressive inlining regressed throughput by 1–6 % across all
//! bands. Selective inline (only the *small* helpers `push_output` /
//! `flush_plain_up_to` / `append_to_frame` / `pending_outputs_pop_front`
//! plus tokenize-stage `flush_text` / `pair_text_then` / `try_merge_double`)
//! brought it within ±1.3 % of baseline — neutral.
//!
//! Conclusion: **LLVM's default inline judgement is already optimal
//! on this code at -O3 + fat-LTO.** Forcing inline on
//! recogniser-wrapping dispatchers regresses via i-cache thrash
//! (the wrappers expand into the per-call hot path and code bloat
//! dominates the dispatch saving). The 88 % "overhead" reported by
//! the instrumented build is partly the instrumentation itself
//! (`Instant::now()` per guard); the production overhead is real but
//! attacking it with attributes alone doesn't move it.
//!
//! The remaining headroom requires *structural* changes (Vec-passing
//! between stages, removing iterator chains) rather than attribute
//! hints.

/// allocation and the `from_segments` collapse pass — a win for the

///
/// ## Slow path
///
/// The fallback is a single `O(body_events)` sweep. `text_start`
/// tracks the earliest byte that has not yet been committed to a Text

/// pair indices, keeping the sweep strictly forward-only regardless
/// of nesting depth.
