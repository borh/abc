//! Pair stage: streaming balanced-stack pairing over the tokenize-stage token stream.
//!
//! Consumes the [`Token`] iterator produced by the tokenize stage and emits a
//! parallel [`PairEvent`] iterator: [`Token::Text`] / [`Token::Newline`]
//! pass through unchanged, and each [`Token::Trigger`] is classified
//! into [`PairEvent::PairOpen`] / [`PairEvent::PairClose`] /
//! [`PairEvent::Solo`] / [`PairEvent::Unmatched`] / [`PairEvent::Unclosed`].
//!
//! ## Why pairing must happen here, not in classify
//!
//! Aozora annotation bodies nest:
//!
//! ```text
//! ［＃「青空」に傍点］:       quoted literal nested inside bracket body
//! ［＃底本では「旧字」］:      same shape, different keyword
//! ［＃「X［＃「Y」に傍点］Z」は底本では「W」］:   doubly nested
//! ```
//!
//! A naïve "find the next `］`" scan hits the *first* `］` even when it
//! closes an inner bracket, yielding a truncated body. This stage runs
//! a proper balanced stack so a body's extent is fixed before any
//! classifier tries to parse it.
//!
//! ## Mismatch policy (current)
//!
//! * **Unclosed open**: left on the stack at end-of-input. The original
//!   `PairOpen` event has already been streamed downstream by the time
//!   we discover the open never closes; instead, on EOF we emit a
//!   synthetic [`PairEvent::Unclosed`] for each still-open frame and
//!   push a [`Diagnostic::UnclosedBracket`]. The classify stage's stack-aware
//!   classifier interprets the trailing `Unclosed` as "the matching
//!   open never closed; treat its accumulated body events as plain".
//! * **Stray close** (empty stack or kind-mismatched top): emitted as
//!   [`PairEvent::Unmatched`] with a [`Diagnostic::UnmatchedClose`].
//!   The stack is not popped (conservative by design, so
//!   a well-formed outer pair like `［...］` still closes correctly even
//!   when an inner stray `》` appears inside the body.
//! * **Bracket is a hard pairing scope** (refines the stray-close rule
//!   for `］` only): a `］` closes the *nearest enclosing* `［`, even when
//!   non-bracket opens are stacked above it, force-resolving those opens
//!   as [`PairEvent::Unclosed`] (innermost-first) before the
//!   [`PairEvent::PairClose`]. This keeps an unbalanced `「` inside a
//!   directive body (an image caption `［＃「…（fig）入る］`, a composed-glyph
//!   gaiji `［＃「口＋「皐」…］`, a typo-note quoting literal quotes) from
//!   preventing closure at `］`, which would otherwise cause the bracket
//!   never to close and sink the rest of the document to plain text. A balanced
//!   body never triggers it, except a closing delimiter quoted as a single glyph. That
//!   glyph is text when immediately followed by its quote closer.
//! * **A non-bracket closer is a hard scope for plain brackets opened inside
//!   it**, but only inside an annotation body: when the nearest enclosing open
//!   of that kind sits inside a bracket itself and has nothing but plain
//!   brackets stacked above it. This resolves a `［` quoted verbatim in a body
//!   (`［＃「［あ」は底本では「（あ」］`), which has no closer of its own and
//!   would otherwise absorb the annotation's `］`. A nested `［＃` is excluded:
//!   it is an annotation in its own right and closes at its own `］`. Outside
//!   an annotation body a closer still cannot cross a bracket downward.
//! * **A plain `［` opened directly in a directive body is text**, with no
//!   quote around it to scope it (`［＃［愛」に「ママ」の注記］`, a source typo
//!   for `「愛」`). It has no closer of its own, so pairing it would hand the
//!   annotation's `］` to the stray opener. The two readings are
//!   indistinguishable at that `］`, so the decision is taken at the open,
//!   where one trigger of lookahead separates a nested `［＃` from a stray `［`.
