//! Lexer token types.
//!
//! The tokenize stage emits a `BumpVec<'a, Token>` (arena-backed) where
//! each token is either a plain [`Token::Text`] range (a run of source
//! bytes between triggers) or a [`Token::Trigger`] carrying the
//! specific delimiter kind that caused the break. The pair stage consumes
//! this stream and applies balanced-stack pairing to build
//! structured events.
//!
//! [`TriggerKind`] lives in [`ab_aozora_spec::TriggerKind`] and is
//! re-exported here for downstream consumers.
