//! Fuzz target — `aozora_pipeline::lex` on arbitrary UTF-8.
//!
//! Arbitrary bytes are decoded as UTF-8 (invalid sequences skip this
//! iteration). The resulting source text is pushed through
//! `lex` and the produced `LexOutput` is sanity-
//! checked: the lexer must terminate without panicking, the
//! normalized text must remain valid UTF-8, and every reported
//! diagnostic span must be in-bounds. Targets parser-side panics in
//! the trigger / pair / classify stages.
//!
//! Run with the standard `just fuzz-{quick,deep,marathon,triage,
//! promote}` family from the workspace root, e.g.
//! `just fuzz-quick aozora-pipeline lex`.
