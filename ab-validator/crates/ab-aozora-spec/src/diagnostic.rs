//! Forked from <https://github.com/P4suta/aozora>
//! at rev 1a4f864603970983719655aa4af4525958ac2d38 (independent fork).
//! Upstream crate: aozora-spec. License: MIT OR Apache-2.0 (see NOTICE).
//!
//! Lexer-emitted observations.
//!
//! A [`Diagnostic`] is non-fatal: the lexer always produces a
//! best-effort output and never aborts mid-stream. Callers decide how
//! to surface the diagnostics: the CLI can render them via
//! [`miette::Report`], tests can assert on the variants, library
//! consumers can ignore them.
//!
//! Every variant carries a byte-range [`Span`] in the *sanitized* source
//! (the sanitize-stage output: BOM stripped, CRLF→LF, 〔…〕 accents decomposed),
//! which is the text the later stages tokenize. To render a snippet,
//! attach that sanitized text (e.g. via `ab_aozora_facade::pipeline::lexer::sanitize`)
//! so miette's caret lands on the right character; for input with no BOM /
//! CRLF / accent digraphs the sanitized text equals the original bytes.
//!
//! # Severity and source axes
//!
//! Diagnostics split along two orthogonal axes:
//!
//! - **[`Severity`]**: `Error` / `Warning` / `Note`. Determines how
//!   strictly a host (CLI, LSP, editor decorator) should treat the
//!   observation. Defaults to `Error` for genuine syntax issues and
//!   `Warning` for input that the parser can carry around but the
//!   user should be told about.
//! - **[`DiagnosticSource`]**: `Source` (problem traces back to
//!   user input) vs. `Internal` (a pipeline-invariant violation;
//!   appearance indicates a library bug). Hosts that filter by
//!   `Internal` get a clear "library bug" channel without having to
//!   match on individual variants.
//!
//! Each variant exposes both axes through accessors
//! ([`Diagnostic::severity`] / [`Diagnostic::source`]).
//!
//! # Internal variant
//!
//! The four library-bug sanity checks
//! (`ResidualAnnotationMarker`, `UnregisteredSentinel`,
//! `RegistryOutOfOrder`, `RegistryPositionMismatch`) live as a single
//! [`Diagnostic::Internal`] variant whose `code` field
//! ([`InternalCheckCode`]) tags the specific check. Tests and tooling
//! match on that code via [`codes`]. Consumers that want to filter
//! library-bug diagnostics out of the [`crate::Diagnostic`] stream
//! reach for [`Diagnostic::source`].
